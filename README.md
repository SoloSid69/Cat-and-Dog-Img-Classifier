# Cat-and-Dog-Img-Classifier
 
**Cat & Dog Image Classification with Keras**

This repository contains the code for a simple Cat & Dog image classification project using Keras, a powerful deep learning framework for TensorFlow. It's a great starting point for anyone interested in exploring image classification and building their own machine learning models.

**What you'll find:**

1) Keras code: Train a CNN model to distinguish between cat and dog images using Keras layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense.

2) Data preprocessing: Learn how to prepare and augment your image dataset for optimal model performance.

3) Model training and evaluation: Understand the training process and how to evaluate your model's accuracy using metrics like accuracy and loss.


**Benefits:**

1) Easy to understand and follow: Even if you're new to deep learning, the code is well-commented and documented for clear understanding.

2) Fully functional: Train and evaluate your own Cat & Dog image classifier right away.

3) Solid foundation: Use this as a base to build more complex image classification models for various tasks.
